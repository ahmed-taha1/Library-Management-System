  description: |
    A comprehensive Library Management System API for managing books, borrowers, and borrowing operations.

    ## Authentication
    Most endpoints require JWT authentication. To authenticate:
    1. Call `POST /api/auth/login` with valid credentials
    2. Use the returned `accessToken` in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer {token}`
    3. Use the `refreshToken` to get new access tokens when they expire

    ## Rate Limiting
    Some endpoints are rate-limited:
    - Book creation: 5 requests per minute
    - Book search: 10 requests per minute

    ## Pagination
    List endpoints support pagination with `page` and `limit` query parameters:
    - `page`: Page number (default: 1)
    - `limit`: Items per page (default: 10, max: 100)

    ## Response Format
    All responses follow a consistent format:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "data": { ... }
    }
    ```

    Error responses:
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "message": "Error description",
        "statusCode": 400
      }
    }
    ```
